Grating interferometry
In this exercise we will process and analyze a dataset from grating
interferometry.

As per usual, replace the ???s with the appropriate command(s).

# darkfield signals.
# You will have to do a one-dimensional Fourier transform of both arrays
# along the stepping dimension (remember that there is a stepping curve
# for each pixel in the images) and normalize by the number of stepping
# images.
# Then extract the signals for the data and the flatfields:
# absorption: the absolute value of the zeroth (DC) term (equivalent to
# the mean value of the stepping curve)
# differential phase: the phase of the first order term (equivalent to
# the phase of the sine curve)
# darkfield: the absolute value of the first order term divided by
# absorpion (equivalent to half of the amplitude of the stepping curve)
