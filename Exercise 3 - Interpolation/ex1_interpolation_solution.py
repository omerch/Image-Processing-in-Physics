ex1_interpolation.py

Using numpy, matplotlib and scipy

The goal of this exercise is for you to try a simple image interpolation
using interpolation kernels. For this you should first downsample an image
and then try to increase its sampling again by using an appropriate
interpolation method.

You need to replace the ??? in the code with the required commands

# Row and column. Hint: remember array indexing, a[i:j:k]

factor = 4

# OPTIONAL TASK: Rebin the old image via averaging.
# Therefore, patches of 4 times 4 pixels are averaged and written into the
# according position of the subarray. You can do this explicitely or
# by reshaping the 2d-array into a 4d array, where the two new axes contain
# the values that are to be averaged

img_sub = np.mean(
    np.reshape(img, (sh[0]/factor, factor, sh[1]/factor, factor)), axis=(1, 3))

# prepare the subsampled image for interpolation by inserting zeros between all
# pixel values in img_sub. img_up should be the same size as the original (img)
# To fill the upscaled image with a sparse matrix, remember stepping in slicing

# Perform sinc interpolation using the convolution theorem and fft
# Hint: the sinc kernel is easier to define in Fourier domain:

#       Its width is given by the width of the subsampled image, sh/factor/2.
