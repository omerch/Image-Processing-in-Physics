ex1_deconvolution.py

Using numpy, matplotlib, scipy

The goal of this exercise is to try out some deconvolution tasks in the
presence of noise. First the "naive" deconvolution, then using the Wiener
filter.
You need to replace the ??? in the code with the required commands.

# Let's create a convolution kernel (PSF) and produce the convolved image. We
# want the convolved image to suffer from motion blur in the direction of the
# diagonal. The function np.diag creates an appropriate convolution kernel.
# The kernel should be 51x51 pixels with 1 on the diagonal, 0 otherwise, and
# then normalized so that the sum of the diagonal is 1.

# As soon as you add a little noise to the image, the naive deconvolution will
# go wrong, since for white noise, the noise power will exceed the signal
# power for high frequencies. Since the inverse filtering also enhances the
# power frequncies the result will be nonsense

# Let's first define the Wiener deconvolution in a seperate function.

    This function performs an image deconvolution using a Wiener filter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img : ndarray
      convolved image
    psf : ndarray
      the convolution kernel
    nps : float or ndarray
      noise power spectrum of the image, you will have to choose an
      appropriate value

    Returns
    -------
    deconvolved_image : ndarray
      The deconvolved image or volume depending on the input image.

    Notes
    -----
    If a float is given as nps, it assumes intrinsically white noise.
    A nps of 0 corresponds to no noise, and therefore naive image
    deconvolution.
