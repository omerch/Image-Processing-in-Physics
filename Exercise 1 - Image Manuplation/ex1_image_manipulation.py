ex1_image_manipulation.py

Using numpy, matplotlib and scipy
The goal of this exercise is for you to become familiar with the important
packages numpy (for n-dimensional array manipulations) and matplotlib (for
matlab-like plotting and visualization).
Your task is to load a provided image into a numpy array and do some basic
manipulations.

You need to replace the ??? in the code with the required commands

# use plt.imread to read in 'tree.jpg' as numpy array, select
# only the red channel. Check the image dimensions with img.shape.
# img_red should contain a 2-dimensional array
# Please note that this is actually a gray scale image and all 3
# image channels are the same.

img = plt.imread('tree.jpg')

# Choose the red color channel. For exploring the shape of your image type
# img.shape into your interpreter to know which axis of the array to take.
# Your img has the shape (640, 640, 3) for 640x640 pixels and 3 color channels.
# To leave the for example the first axis untouched type img[:, something]
# You can always check the result by img_red.shape -> should be (640, 640)

img_red = img[:, :, 0]

# show img_red with plt.imshow

# Using imread, the image values returns unsigned integers between 0 and 255
# Add a colorbar to verify the range of values.

plt.colorbar()

# Create a new numpy array that is the subarray containing only the tree in
# the image. Then invert the intensity values of the small subimage and call
# the resulting array img_crop_inv

# Use slicing to select the tree (get the coordinates by looking at the image)

img_crop = img_red[360:480, 370:490].copy()

# tree from its background

# Define a threshold. You can check by looking at the image colorbar, if your

# Use nd.rotate? to see the function definition in ipython interpreter or
# help(nd.rotate) in python interpreter or look it up in spyder (recommended)
